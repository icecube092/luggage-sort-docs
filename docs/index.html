  <h1>Privacy Policy for Luggage Sort</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile game <strong>Luggage Sort</strong> (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App on Android (including via Google Play).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App may collect or receive the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game progress and save data</strong> — such as completed levels and in-app progress, stored on your device and optionally synced with Google Play Games Services (cloud save) if you sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising-related data</strong> — the App uses Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob and its partners may collect device identifiers, IP address, and usage data for ad delivery and measurement. This is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> and, where applicable, the <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Games Services</strong> — if you sign in with your Google account, Google may process your account identifier and game data (e.g. cloud saves, achievements) according to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve the game (e.g. saving progress, syncing across devices via Google Play Games).</li>
    <li>To show and measure ads (via AdMob and its partners).</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses the following third-party services, each with their own privacy practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — advertising. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob Help</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Games Services</strong> — sign-in and cloud save. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ad partners (including mediation networks) may also collect data as described in their policies and in the App’s consent flow (e.g. consent form shown in the App).</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Game progress is stored on your device. If you use cloud save, a copy is stored on Google’s servers. We do not run our own servers that store your personal data. We rely on Google’s security measures for data processed by Google services.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can disable personalized ads in your device settings (e.g. Android: Settings → Google → Ads).</li>
    <li>You can sign out of Google Play Games in the App or in your device/Google account settings to stop cloud save sync.</li>
    <li>Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data; contact us or the relevant provider (e.g. Google) as appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we make changes. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this Privacy Policy or the App’s data practices, please contact us at: <strong>info@aintdev.online</strong>.</p>
